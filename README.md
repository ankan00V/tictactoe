ðŸ”¹ Project Overview: Crafted a Tic Tac Toe game enabling two players to take turns, validating wins and ties, and displaying the board post each move.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps:
- Board Initialization: Established a 3x3 grid with a 2D vector.
- Printing the Board: Implemented a function to exhibit the current board state.
- Move Validation: Ensured valid player moves with in the grid.
- Win/Tie Detection: Integrated logic to identify wins and ties.
- Game Loop: Created a loop for player turns until game completion.

ðŸ”¹ Concepts Applied:
- Vectors: Employed STL vectors for dynamic array handling.
- Conditionals & Loops: Utilized for control flow and iteration.
- Functions: Modularized code for enhanced readability.
- Constants: Defined player symbols and board size constants for code clarity.

ðŸ”¹ **Compilation & Execution**:
1. Save the code as `tic_tac_toe.cpp`.
2. Compile using `g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp`.
3. Run the executable with `./tic_tac_toe`.
